# The Countdown - An EscapeRoom Project
A companion app for our Escape Room project "The Countdown" for NLT.

## Installation
### MacOS
First, download the [latest release](https://github.com/GeneralNobody/EscapeRoom/releases/latest) which matches your OS, in this case the version which has 'darwin' in its name.  
Then, open your *Terminal* application, which can be found in the *Utilities* folder in the Launchpad.  
Find your installed file, likely in the *Downloads* folder, unzip it and drag and drop the binary into your *Terminal* application window.  
If the program doesn't start, but you instead get a `Permission denied` response, type this in your terminal:  
```$ sudo chmod a+x *insert program path here*```.
To insert the program path, just drag and drop the program into the *Terminal* window again. You will have to enter your administrator password.

### Windows
First, download the [latest release](https://github.com/GeneralNobody/EscapeRoom/releases/latest) from the releases tab which matches your OS, in this case the version which has 'win_x64' in its name.  
Then, double-click on the .exe file and a *Command Prompt* window will open with the program.

### Linux
Linux support is coming soon, please stay tuned!

## Usage
When you have the program running, you will be greeted by a screen in which you will have to fill out all the answers for each of the tasks and then type *finish* to complete.  
Then, the program will start to work its magic and check all of your answers one after the other. If one of your answers isn't correct, the program will ask you to retry and this will go on until the answer is valid. Once it is valid it will continue to check the remaining answers in the same way. Then, if all of your answers are correct, the bomb will be defused and you will have won "The Countdown"!
